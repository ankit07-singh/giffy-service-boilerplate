# Giffy Service

## Background

Giffy Service is a Spring Boot RESTful service that allows users to manage Gif images. 
The current code base is incomplete and acts as a boilerplate. 


## ToDo

2. Complete the REST Service by writing code for the controller, service, and repository layers
3. Write test cases for each layer
4. Push to your github repository
5. Submit URL

Note: You can use any backend database.
